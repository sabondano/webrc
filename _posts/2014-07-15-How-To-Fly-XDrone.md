How To Fly XDrone
-----------------

Follow the steps below for a smooth first flight. The most important thing to remember is that the XDrone's sensors will attempt to calibrate themselves at the 3 second mark after turning the XDrone on (you turn it on by plugging in the battery). If the XDrone is not in a perfectly flat surface (the ground) 3 seconds after turning it on the sensors won't be able to calibrate correctly.

Before flying outdoors look for our article on how to use L1(power selector). You must set power to 100% when flying outdoors. Do not fly outdoors on windy days.
