How To Trim XDrone
------------------

**Requirements**

Before attempting to trim the XDrone go through our lesson titled ['How To Fly XDrone'](/quadcopters/xdrone/2014/07/15/how-to-fly-xdrone.html).

**How**

To trim the XDrone you have to use the silver buttons next to and beneath the joysticks. 

Regardless, in most cases when an XDrone is not flying perfectly straight itâ€™s because the user has not calibrated the sensors correctly.

To trim use the correct trim button and adjust it to your liking:

1. The silver button beneath the left joystick trims it counter clockwise and clockwise.

2. The silver button next to the left joystick trims it up/down.

3. The silver button beneath the right joystick trims it left/right.

4. The silver button next to the right joystick trims it forward/backward.

Now you know how to trim your XDrone. Go out there and practice! Remember that 99% of the time your XDrone is not balanced it's because you took more than 3 seconds to place it on a flat surface after plugging in the battery. The trim is only for minor adjustments. Read our article on [how to fly the XDrone](/quadcopters/xdrone/2014/07/15/how-to-fly-xdrone.html) before your first flight.
